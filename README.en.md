# ThinkFlow AI

[中文](./README.md) | English

**ThinkFlow AI** is a next-generation, local-first, AI-driven mind mapping tool built with Vue 3 and VueFlow. More than just a drawing app, it serves as a "brain augmentor" that thinks with you. By combining the divergent capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) with structured visualization, ThinkFlow AI rapidly transforms fuzzy ideas into clear, deep knowledge systems.

This project was built through Vibe Coding (requirement-driven, AI-assisted iteration).

## 🌟 Why ThinkFlow AI?

Traditional mind mapping tools often require manual entry of every branch, which can become a bottleneck during a burst of inspiration. ThinkFlow AI redefines this process:

1.  **AI-Driven Automated Divergence**: Enter a core keyword, and the AI automatically expands outward based on logical chains, helping you break through "blank page anxiety."
2.  **Context-Aware Deep Dialogue**: Every node carries its full path context within the thinking tree. This means the AI understands _why_ you moved from A to B, generating more precise follow-up suggestions.
3.  **Multi-Dimensional Sensory Presentation**: Gain textual knowledge through deep "Answers," visual imagery through AI Image Generation, and macro insights through "Session Summaries."
4.  **Ultimate Privacy & Freedom**: Adopts a local-first architecture. Configurations are stored locally in your browser. Supports any OpenAI-compatible interface with no platform lock-in.

## 🚀 Core Functional Architecture

### 1. Intelligent Expansion System

- **Core Idea Activation**: Generate the foundation of your thinking tree with one click.
- **Path Contextual Follow-up**: Perform follow-ups on nodes; the AI reasons using the full logical path from the root to the current node.
- **Node Management**: Supports subtree collapsing for large-scale graphs to keep the workspace clean.

### 2. Deep Dive & Summarization

- **Deep Answer (Deep Dive)**: Generates 300-500 words of professional analysis for specific concepts, supporting rich Markdown formatting.
- **Visual Generation (Image Gen)**: Utilizes CogView or DALL-E to generate photorealistic visuals for nodes, reinforcing visual memory.
- **Global Summary**: Automatically analyzes the entire graph's logic to extract core insights and conclusions.

### 3. Canvas Interaction & Layout

- **Smart Tree Layout**: Built-in algorithm based on dynamic subtree height calculations to solve overlap issues after node expansion.
- **Linked Dragging**: When a parent node moves, child nodes move synchronously to maintain relative positions.
- **Versatile Export**: Perfectly supports exporting to structured Markdown, preserving all deep answer content.

## ⚙️ Deployment Configuration (Self-Hosting Guide)

If you wish to self-host this project (e.g., for internal use or sharing with friends), we **strongly recommend** modifying the default backend service configuration to avoid rate limits on the public demo endpoints.

### 1. Modifying Default Config

Open `src/services/config.ts` and modify the `DEFAULT_CONFIG` constant:

```typescript
// src/services/config.ts

/**
 * Default API Configuration
 * Modify this to point to your private API services
 */
export const DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
    chat: {
        // Your Chat API endpoint (OpenAI compatible)
        // If you encounter CORS issues, use it with vite.config.ts proxy (e.g., '/api/chat')
        baseUrl: 'https://your-private-api.com/v1/chat/completions',
        // Default model name
        model: 'gpt-4o',
        // (Optional) If your API requires authentication, enter the key here,
        // or leave it empty for users to enter in the frontend settings
        apiKey: ''
    },
    image: {
        // Your Image Generation endpoint
        baseUrl: 'https://your-private-api.com/v1/images/generations',
        model: 'dall-e-3',
        apiKey: ''
    }
}
```

### 2. Handling CORS Issues

If your API does not support CORS, you can configure a proxy in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
    // ... other configs
    server: {
        proxy: {
            '/api': {
                target: 'https://your-private-api.com/v1',
                changeOrigin: true,
                rewrite: path => path.replace(/^\/api/, '')
            }
        }
    }
})
```

After configuring the proxy, update `baseUrl` in `config.ts` to a relative path (e.g., `/api/chat/completions`).

### 3. Build Project

```bash
npm run build
```

## ⚙️ API Service Description (Public Demo)

To provide an out-of-the-box experience, this project includes a default set of demo endpoints.

### 1. Demo Endpoint Details

- **Service Proxying**: Default requests are proxied and controlled via **Cloudflare Workers & Pages**.
- **Model Support**: Currently connected to Zhipu Bigmodel (glm-4-flash / cogview-3-flash) using free tiers.
- **Limitations**: As these are public demo endpoints, you may encounter rate limits or exhausted quotas.

### 2. Advanced Usage (Custom Endpoints)

For more stable and higher-quality generation (e.g., using GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.), we strongly recommend configuring your own API endpoints in **Settings**:

- **Base URL**: Your API proxy address (must support CORS).
- **Model**: Target model name.
- **API Key**: Your private key.

_Note: In custom mode, requests are sent directly from your browser to the target endpoint, bypassing any intermediaries for maximum security and efficiency._
